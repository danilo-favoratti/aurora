Generate a pixel art scene in the following style:

- **Art Style**: Medium-detail pixel art with no visible pixels and a not defined pixel grid.
- **Color Palette**: Vibrant and saturated colors, warm and cohesive tones.
- **Shading**: Soft but clearly pixelated shading, avoiding smooth gradients or antialiasing.
- **Lighting**: Cinematic directional lighting with subtle glowing highlights on key elements.
- **Character Design**: Rounded, expressive features with cartoon like proportions for a charming or whimsical effect.
- **Background**: Fully illustrated in the same pixel art style, matching pixel density, no empty areas or flat color fills.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent pixel size across all elementsâ€”characters, objects, and background.
- **Canvas**: 512x512 pixels, fully filled, no transparent or empty space.

The entire image must feel handcrafted in a traditional pixel art style, with no modern smooth rendering effects, keeping every visual element sharp and pixel-perfect.
