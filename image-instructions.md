Generate a pixel art scene in the following style:

Art Style: High-resolution pixel art with a visible, handcrafted pixel structure. The pixel grid should be clean and intentional—avoid noisy or repetitive textures that create a leathery or tiled appearance.

Color Palette: Natural but vibrant—lean into balanced, true-to-life hues rather than oversaturated tones. Use a broader mix of mid-range colors (soft blues, warm ambers, gentle greens) and reserve the brightest accents for focal details.

Shading: Use soft pixel shading with deliberate light-to-dark transitions. Dithering is permitted but should be subtle and used only to support smooth transitions—avoid over-texturing. Keep shapes crisp.

Lighting: Subtle, even lighting with a neutral-to-warm bias—no strong “golden-hour” glow. Soft shadows grounded in a single, consistent light source, but keep contrast moderate for a natural feel.
Apply soft directional shadows, particularly along the edges of the character and key highlights, to give the scene volume.

Character Design: Realistic human proportions with expressive but grounded facial and body features. Avoid exaggerated cartoon anatomy. The overall vibe should remain approachable and stylized, but not chibi or caricature.

Background: Solid or lightly textured background matching the pixel density and lighting style of the character. It should be fully illustrated, free of flat color fills, and consistent in pixel scale with the rest of the scene.

Consistency: Maintain uniform pixel size and density across all elements—character, background, objects. No upscaling artifacts or mismatched resolutions.

Canvas: 1024×1024 pixels, entirely filled. No transparent space or empty regions.

Overall Vibe: The image should evoke a handcrafted, cohesive pixel art scene, rich in detail and stylized lighting, while allowing full creative freedom for the scene’s subject and composition.

Text: Do not include any lettering, labels, or typography in the image.
